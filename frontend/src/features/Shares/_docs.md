## Components
Share components display.

## Composites
Before creating a new share, we scan all dependencies (menus, forms, tables, actions, ...) and send them to the server.

## Store
Use for tracking when a user received a share email and clicked the link. We keep track of when the link was clicked and what shareId it is for.
